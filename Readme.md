# Features

This module adds a new way of rotating tiles and tokens: shift+dragging towards the intended direction. This is in 
addition to the default methods of rotation a token in Foundry - shift+scrolling while hovering over it, and shift+arrows
when selecting it. 

Hold the **Shift** key and drag with the left mouse button away from a token. The token will rotate to face the cursor, 
settling when you let go of the mouse button.

You can also hold Shift while dragging in an empty spot while having multiple tiles/tokens selected; this will make all
selected tiles/tokens turn to face your cursor, until you release the mouse button.  

By holding **Shift+Ctrl**, rotation will snap to the grid directions (same directions you'd snap to when doing the default 
"fast rotation" in Foundry; 45° or 60°). With Shift only, rotation will snap to 5 degrees, though you can completely
disable even this snapping in the settings (*"Smooth rotation"*).

Rotation will assume that the bottom of the token image is its "front"; the token looks down when viewing its image.
This is the most common standard for token images.

By default, *"Fast Preview"* is enabled in the settings. It makes your token rotation feel fast and responsive, but it
will not update the token until you let go of the mouse; this means the other players will only see the changes when you
stop rotating the tokens. If you want to show an enemy smoothly rotating to face the players, you should disable this
setting.

Here's an example of how "Fast Preview" looks like when disabled. The right screen is what you see, and the left screen
is what other players will see.
